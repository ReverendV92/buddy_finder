The Buddy Finder is an addon for Garry's Mod that allows you to teleport to players

Buddy Finder was originally created in 2009 by a user named 'ancientevil' and was updated in 2015 by Jesse 'V92' Vanover.

Buddy Finder allows you to use the self-named Scripted Weapon (SWep) to dial other players on the server and teleport to them if they accept your call.
The BF also allows you to PM them in the form of text messages.

The Buddy Finder addon includes a piece of code that gives it to every player on spawn so that players will not have to manually spawn it each time they spawn.
